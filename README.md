## Hi there 👋

I'm Akmal, an IT professional majoring in Data and AI based in Indonesia. Now employed as a Data Annotator.
I create and do some experiments on whatever interests me to dive in.
When some cases draw attention to me, chances are I'll give it a shot to see what solutions I can offer.

My main techs are Python (with ML-related libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, etc.), Jupyter, n8n, and JavaScript. Also, creative-related tools are Canva, CapCut, CorelDRAW, and Figma.

I'm a freshly graduated from the Computer Science major in Bachelor's Degree (February 2025), still so much journey to come! I keep updating any projects I dive in, but please take a look at what I've done before. Please get to know me more on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m-akmal-hafizh/)!

_Fun Facts:_
- I'm also doing creative things (writing stories, designing, creating content videos, etc.)
- I really like an RPG-kindish game (now mainly in Roblox)
- I do like watching some anime.
- Hobbies: Playing games, watching YouTube/anime, and learn some new things!
